# Motivation 

With the advent of public health and medical care, 
the life expetancy has increased over past half century. 
The society is aging, and there are more and more 
researchers trying to understand the underlying mechanism
why human age, and the potential modifiable facorts to 
decelerate the aging process. To achieve these goals, some 
researchers proposed some metrics to capture the  functional
aging, such as frailty index, and further investigate the 
relationship between functional aging and disability/mortality. 
With the hypothesis that functions are especially important 
for older people and applying potential approaches to improve 
functions may maximize human's quality of life and prolong 
longevity, functional aging has been one of the main foci
in geriatric research over past two decades. Consequently, 
it is of vital importance to understand the drivers of 
functional declines, which can be potentially measured by 
changes of phenotypes. 


To understand the biological mechanism of aging, several metrics
of biological age, such as epgenetic clock, have been proposed. 
Among these proposed metrics, most of them utilized the data 
available, and leverage 
on the dimension reduction tools and choose the statitical 
model fit the mortality the best as biological age. With lack of 
a more conceptual and mechanistic framework, these metrics may
be useful for mortality or cormorbitidy prediction, 
but may not be able to capture the earlier change of aging.  


Thus, we propose a temporal heirarchy framework for metrics of aging, 
in which phenotypes serve as the bridge between underlying biological
drivers of aging and the functional decline we observe.
Earlier this year, the concept has been described by [Dr. Luigi Ferrucci et al](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312816), 
and is shown as following:


```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.ahajournals.org/cms/attachment/95caf10e-c752-40b4-8dd9-9e04e4ed8a89/740fig03.gif")
```

with proposed measures as following:  

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE, out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.ahajournals.org/cms/attachment/58a653ae-d966-4816-8939-4464baa0c504/740fig01.gif")
```

With an attempt to understand these temporal heirarchy of aging, 
in Baltimore Loungitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), not only the 
functions, but also the proposed phenotypes were measured within 
participants with relatively health status when recruited, for 
the purpose of diminishing the effect of diseases as more as possible. 


In this paper, we try to understand: 

*1. Are the proposed phenotypes appropriate in terms of functional decline?*    
*2. Do the proposed phenotyes within the same domain capture similar properties? And do the prosposed phenotyeps accross different domians capture the construct of aging?* 


# Are the proposed phenotypes appropriate? 


```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE, out.width='90%'}

```

The proposed measures have been earlier described in one paper published on
[Circulatoin Research](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.312816).
